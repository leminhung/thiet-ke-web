      <h2>Over 1,000 HaUI lecturers, staff and students have been vaccinated against COVID-19</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>In the face of the complicated situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, HaUI has always clearly determined that in order to
          prevent and combat the pandemic, in addition to the serious implementation of the 5K message (in Vietnamese: Khau trang
          - Facemask, Khu khuan - Disinfection, Khoang cach - Distance, Khong tu tap - No gathering, Khai bao y te - Health
          declaration), COVID-19 vaccination is a key component in ensuring the sustainable development of the university and
          community. Up to now, HaUI in collaboration with Bac Tu Liem District Medical Center and other health authorities has given the
          first dose of COVID-19 vaccine to more than 1,000 lecturers, staff and 125 students staying in the university dormitory
          including 45 international students from Laos and Mozambique. <br> <br>
          Nearly 200 lecturers and staff have received the second
          shot. Presenting at the vaccination site, NUANCHAN Pheng - a Lao student majoring in Automotive Technology shared his feeling:
          "When I heard that international students were supported by the university to receive the COVID-19 vaccination, I and my
          friends who were staying in the dormitory felt really happy. After getting vaccinated, I’m relieved that I can return to
          my normal study conditions in the near future. I would like to thank the university administrators and teachers who take
          care and create the best conditions for us." HaUI has always actively stood by and shared community responsibilities. Previously, in response to the call "All people
          unite, make every effort to prevent and fight the COVID-19 pandemic" of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland
          Front; promoting the tradition of solidarity, fellow feeling and community responsibility, the University Trade Union
          has launched a movement to support and contribute to the prevention and control of COVID-19. 100% of lecturers and staff
          donated at least one day salary to join hands with the whole country to fight the pandemic. The university also donated
          VND 200 million to the "COVID-19 Vaccine Fund" at the Vietnam Fatherland Front Committee of Bac Tu Liem district.
